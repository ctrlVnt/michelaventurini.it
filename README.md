## This project was started with Lovable.dev

This website was entirely generated following a single prompt command on Lovable.dev, where I made some minor adjustments and changed texts and images.

### What do I think about it?

There are many things I could say about this.

First of all, the technological evolution is impressive, but is it really an advantage? I have some doubts.

The first issue is about the banality of AI; as you can see, it looks like a template website.

The second issue is about the code. Every programmer knows how personal coding style can be, so sometimes it can be less productive to correct existing code.

Certainly, when used strategically as an assistant, it can save a lot of time on tasks that would manually take much longer, or in explaining certain concepts (be careful, as there are many hidden inaccuracies).

Having said that, while I can agree with no-code solutions, I am absolutely against pure "vibe coding." If I weren't a programmer, I probably wouldn't have been able to replace the images.

_A small note: Can we say that AI is creative? Even human creativity often draws inspiration from existing things._
